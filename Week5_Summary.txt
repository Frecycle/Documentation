WEEK 5 SUMMARY

According to old design, bottom navigation view was communicating with small views linked to an activity called fragment.
But since making the main views of the project with fragments would make it even more difficult, we linked the buttom navigation view to 4 different activities called home, search, favorites and my account.
Because the tasks of these views are different, they have to be different activities. They should not be connected to an activity.
On the other hand, we started profile page design. We did the requirements analysis.
